# PharmaLens - AI-Powered Medication Identification for Africa

## Project Overview
PharmaLens is a groundbreaking mobile-first web application designed to address critical healthcare challenges in Africa by leveraging artificial intelligence to identify medications and provide essential safety information through a simple photo. Tailored for the African context, PharmaLens prioritizes accessibility, with voice-based interaction and support for multiple local languages to serve communities with varying literacy levels.

## The African Healthcare Challenge

### The Problem
Across Africa, medication safety is a pressing concern due to several unique challenges:

1. **Counterfeit Medications**: The WHO estimates that up to 42% of medicines in Africa are substandard or falsified, leading to thousands of preventable deaths annually.

2. **Limited Healthcare Access**: With only 2.2 doctors per 10,000 people (compared to 35 per 10,000 in Europe), many Africans self-medicate without professional guidance.

3. **Literacy Barriers**: Average adult literacy rates in Sub-Saharan Africa are approximately 65%, making traditional medication labels difficult to understand.

4. **Multilingual Populations**: With over 2,000 languages spoken across the continent, language barriers prevent proper medication understanding.

5. **Supply Chain Issues**: Poor storage conditions and distribution challenges can affect medication efficacy.

## Our Solution

PharmaLens addresses these challenges through an innovative, AI-powered platform that:

### 1. Medication Identification
- **Visual Recognition**: Identify medications using photos of pills, packaging, or labels
- **Local Formulary**: Database includes medications commonly found in African markets and healthcare facilities
- **Barcode & Batch Verification**: Check medication authenticity and expiry information

### 2. Safety & Accessibility
- **Voice-First Interface**: Fully operable through voice commands in multiple African languages
- **Audio Descriptions**: Read medication instructions aloud in local languages
- **Visual Aids**: Use of symbols and images to convey important information

### 3. Counterfeit Detection
- **Visual Analysis**: AI-powered detection of suspicious packaging or pill characteristics
- **Community Reporting**: Users can report suspicious medications to help protect others
- **Verification Tools**: Cross-reference medication appearance with known authentic samples

### 4. Localized Support
- **Multilingual Interface**: Currently supports English, French, Swahili, and Arabic with more languages in development
- **Regional Variations**: Accounts for different medication names and formulations across African countries
- **Offline Functionality**: Core features work without internet connectivity
